Since I'm switching among computers, and I don't want to set up the enviroment again and again (of cause, some steps can't be skipped like system installing), it could be better if I could make it automatic.

Actually this idea came up because I saw similar things in: https://github.com/amix/vimrc

And another thing that inspires me doing this is <The Progmatic Programmer>: we need to make it automatic if possible.

[How to use]
First clone this git somewhere, for example:'~/myenv', "envfolder" indicate the git folder in the below description
===bashrc===
echo 'source envfolder/bashrc' >> ~/.bashrc

===vimrc===
ln envfolder/vimrc ~/.vimrc

===gitconfig===
sudo cp envfolder/gitconfig /etc/
