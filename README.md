The original purpose of this git is to help sync configs among computers. And recent years I found that it's better to have only one dev computer: Mac Book Pro.

So it's now a git only to keep the basic config files.

Here are the configs I'm trying to keep:

~/.bash_profile -> bash_profile
~/.gitconfig -> gitconfig
~/.vimrc -> init.base.vim + init.vundle.vim
~/.ideavimrc -> ideavimrc
