Since I'm switching among computers, and I don't want to set up the enviroment again and again (of cause, some steps can't be skipped like system installing), so it could be better if I could make it automatic.

Actually this idea came up because I saw similar things in: https://github.com/amix/vimrc

And another thing that inspires me doing this is <The Progmatic Programmer>: we need to make it automatic if possible.
